how can you optimise your react application?:
Memo, useMemo, seCallback, useRef, lazyLoading,..


useRef() => 

1. it is a hook which is used to get the reference of the DOM element.
2. useful to mantain the state between 2 renders.


lazyLoading() =>

I will load on demand.

I will first render the components needed, then i will render other components as when needed or on demand.


Routing =>

React does not have a router if its own.
hence we have to install react-router-dom package.

RRD = 2ways:

1.:

1. install RRD.
2.
3.in main.jsx:
get the App inside BrowserRouter like:
<BrowserRouter>
    <App>
<BrowserRouter>

and import (BrowserRouter) form 'react-router-dom'

and we can also wrap up inside Router and import Router as well, like:
<BrowserRouter>
    <Router>
        <App>
    <Router>
<BrowserRouter>

import (BrowserRouter, Router) form 'react-router-dom'
but we will not use it.


only <BrowserRouter> wrapping helps to acces every functionality of RRD, which is not possible inside Router.

4. Inside App.jsx, create a Routes element inside a parent element and set up the different Route ath in it.
like:
<Routes>
    <Route path = '/' element = {<Home/>} />
    <Route path = '/Dashboard' element = {<Dashboard/>} />
    <Route path = '/Profile' element = {<Profile/>} />
</Routes>

and import { Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from './components/Home';
import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';
import Profile from './components/Profile';

while creating home,Dashboard,prfile, components seperately.

but in network we get to see dashboard, profile in home page which means they are prerendered or installed .
but we want them to be on our demand.

so instead of loading we will lazyLoad it.

for this we write the import statement of dashboard and profile in a different manner.
we use React.lazy method which accepts a call back function.
and make Dashboard as a varibale and asiign it to the lazy method.
like:
// import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';
const Dashboard = React.lazy( ()=> import ('./components/Dashboard'))
// import Profile from './components/Profile';
const Profile = React.lazy( ()=> import ('./components/Profile'))

and rather then writing directly in return of App we write it using suspense and fallback.
fallback is the message that will be shown until the profile is loaded.
<Route path = '/Dashboard' element = {<Suspense fallback = "Loading1..."><Dashboard/></Suspense>} />
<Route path = '/Profile' element = {<Suspense fallback = "loading2..."><Profile/></Suspense>} />
import { Suspense} from 'react';

we will use link using <link to = '..' >...</link>
