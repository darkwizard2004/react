before learning useMemo we have to get some basic idea of input and its important features.

we use input like - 

<input type = "text" name = "" id = "" />  

but by default it is uncontrollable 

so to control it, we have 3 things:
1. state
2. Evenet handler
3. value

useMemo -> hook -> memoization of value.
useCallback -> hook -> memoization of functions.

note:
let x = {a:10};
let y = {a:10};
x === y --> false;

let a = [10,20,30];
let b = [10,20,30];

a === b --> false;

every objects and array are refrentially diifferent.
similarly functions are also refrentially diifferent.
